Instructions:

For this assignment please complete the following exercises.  In addition to the requirements stated in these exercises for any classes that you create you should also create a class diagram using UML and a use case diagram.

Write a program that converts a number entered in Roman numerals to decimal form. Your program should consist of a class, romanType. An object of romanType should do the following:

Store the number as a Roman numeral.
Convert and store the number into decimal form.
Print the number as a Roman numeral or decimal number as requested by the user. (Write two separate functionsâ€”one to print the number as a Roman numeral and the other to print the number as a decimal number.)
The decimal values of the Roman numerals are:

M 1000
D 500
C 100
L 50
X 10
V   5
I   1
Remember, a larger numeral preceding a smaller numeral means addition, so LX is 60. A smaller numeral preceding a larger numeral means subtrac- tion, so XL is 40. Any place in a decimal number, such as the 1s place, the 10s place, and so on, requires from zero to four Roman numerals.

Test your program using the following Roman numerals: MCXIV, CCCLIX, and MDCLXVI.


Documentation:

I have created a program that will depending on the user's decision, either convert a roman numeral to a decimal form or a decimal form to a roman numeral. 
The program uses a Roman class and initializes variables and getters. The function double_roman will permit the user to convert from a decimal to a roman numeral. The function roman_decimal permit the user to convert from roman numeral to a decimal.


Goal:
The program runs perfectly without any run problems or code mistake. The user is succefully able to convert from either roman numeral to decimal form or from decimal form to roman numerals.
